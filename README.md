# 2D-grid-city-python
A project implementing A* algorithm in Python for path planning on a 2D grid.

Objective: I'm building this project to explore the fundamentals of path planning. Success looks like a visual agent efficiently and consistently navigates from start to end points on a 2D grid leveraging the A* algorithm. Why A*?

Project Outline:

Goal: To implement an A* pathfinding algorithm in Python, visualize the planned path, and gain foundational navigation knowledge applicable to autonomous vehicle development. Technologies Used: Python, matplotlib (for visualization). Key Concepts: Graph traversal and heuristic search. Pathfinding in the context of autonomous systems.

Structure:

pr1/: Contains the main Python code.
docs/: Diagrams and visual outputs of the project.
tests/: Any unit tests to validate functionality.
